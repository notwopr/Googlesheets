Google Scripting Projects to enhance Google Sheets' Functionality

The file here is a code I wrote to retrieve various stock prices from a list of stock names.  Specifically it would retrieve the closing prices for each stock from the start date specified to the day before the current day.

This is a google script meant to be run on a google sheet.
The spreadsheet itself had one sheet to begin with which contained all the input data needed: the Start date, the list of the stocks and their ticker symbols.

I also added a few more sheets that calculate various metrics, such as percentage change of the price from day to day, the overall gain/loss percentage from date of purchase, and a sheet that shows the average daily change rate over a specified time span.

Feel Free to use my script as you choose.
